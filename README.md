Program to filter out duplicates in a network of addresses

This is a solution to a software dev interview assignment. We get a .csv file of street addresses (unordered), the task is to filter out any "house numbers" that are duplicates in the network. The challenge is that the entries in the CSV are "intervals", not singular addresses.
